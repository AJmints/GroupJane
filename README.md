# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Rally is a website that is tailored to a specific neighborhood within a city that provides information, resources, services, opportunities, and connections with residents. Our team was interested in fulfilling a need to foster increased community connection. Rally intends to accomplish this task and may include features that are not normally available on other social networking sites into a centralized hub, and tailored to the local scope. The webpage will be broken into multiple tabs. Users will be allowed to create a user profile with a unique identity and login. There will also be a community forum for messaging; an events page to offer project ideas and to solicit volunteers; a page with restaurant listings in the community with reviews; a services page listing offers or requests for freelance work, ridesharing, dogwalking, or childcare; and a resources tab that includes a table of local information with tags.
